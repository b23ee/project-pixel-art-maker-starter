# Pixel Art Maker Project

**What is the Pixel Art Maker?**
This is a fork of the Pixel Art Maker lab in Udacity's Frontend Web Developer Nanodegree program. The course provided starter code that I am using to build this single page web app.

**How does it work?**
The Pixel Art Maker allows users to set the height and width of a grid, then select colors to "paint" in squares on the grid and make designs of their choosing....it's pretty cool!
